### OpenTofu: An Open Source Fork of Terraform

OpenTofu is an open source, community-driven alternative to Terraform, enabling users to define, provision, and manage infrastructure resources using declarative configuration files. It is fully compatible with existing Terraform configurations and workflows, offering a vendor-neutral and open governance model.

## Getting Started

This repository provides a collection of infrastructure as code examples and best practices using OpenTofu, an open source alternative to Terraform. The examples are written in the Terraform language and are designed for use with OpenTofu.
